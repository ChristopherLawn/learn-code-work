    description: "Perl is a highly capable, feature-rich programming language with over 30 years of development. Perl runs on over 100 platforms from portables to mainframes and is suitable for both rapid prototyping and large scale development projects.  'Perl' is a family of languages, 'Raku' (formerly known as 'Perl 6') is part of the family, but it is a separate language which has its own development team. Its existence has no significant impact on the continuing development of 'Perl'.",
